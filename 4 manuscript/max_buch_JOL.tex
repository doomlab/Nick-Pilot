  \abstract{This study examined the interactive relationship between semantic,
thematic, and associative word pair strength in the prediction of
judgments and cued-recall performance. One hundred and twelve
participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. They were
shown word pairs of varying relatedness and were then asked to judge
these word pairs for their semantic, thematic, and associative strength.
After completing a distractor task, participants then completed a cued
recall task. The data was then analyzed through multilevel modeling,
incorporating a logistic regression to account for the binary nature of
the recall. Four hypotheses were tested. First, we sought to expand
previous work on memory judgments to include three types of judgments of
memory, while also replicating bias and sensitivity findings. Next, we
tested for an interaction between the three database norms (FSG, COS,
and LSA) when predicting participant judgments. Third, we extended this
analysis to test for interactions between the three database norms when
predicting recall. In both our second and third hypothesis, significant
three-way interactions were found between FSG, COS, and LSA when
predicting judgments or recall. For low semantic feature overlap,
thematic and associative strength were competitive; as thematic strength
increased, associative predictiveness decreased. However, this trend
reversed for high semantic feature overlap, wherein thematic and
associative strength were complimentary as both set of simple slopes
increased together. Finally, we showed that judgment-database slopes
were predictive of recall.}

The study of cognition has a rich history of exploring the role of
association in human memory. One key finding is that elements of
cognitive processing play a critical role in how well an individual
retains learned information. Throughout the mid-20th century, much
research was conducted that investigated this notion, particularly
through the use of paired-associate learning (PAL). In this paradigm,
participants are presented with a pair of items and are asked to make
connections between them so that the presentation of one item (the cue)
will in turn trigger the recall of the other (the target). Early studies
of this nature focused primarily on the effects of meaning and imagery
on recall performance. Smythe and Paivio (1968) found that noun imagery
played a crucial role in PAL performance; subjects were much more likely
to remember word-pairs that were low in meaning similarity if imagery
between the two was high. Subsequent studies in this area focused on the
effects of mediating variables on PAL tasks as well as the effects of
imagery and meaningfulness on associative learning (Richardson, 1998),
with modern studies shifting their focus towards a broad range of
applied topics such as how PAL is effected by aging (Hertzog, Kidder,
Powell-Moman, \& Dunlosky, 2002), its effects on second language
acquisition (Chow, 2014), and even in evolutionary psychology (Schwartz
\& Brothers, 2013).

Early PAL studies routinely relied on stimuli generated from word lists
that focused extensively on measures of word frequency, concreteness,
meaningfulness, and imagery (Paivio, 1969). However, the word pairs in
these lists were typically created due to their apparent relatedness or
frequency of occurrence in text. While lab self-generation appears face
valid, one finds that this method of selection lacks a decisive method
of defining the underlying relationships between the pairs (Buchanan,
2010). Additionally, these variables capture psycholinguistic
measurement of an individual concept (i.e.~how concrete is cat and word
occurrence). PAL is, by definition, used on word pairs, which requires
examining concept relation in a reliable manner. As a result, free
association norms have become a common means of indexing associative
strength between word pairs (Nelson, McEvoy, \& Schreiber, 2004). As we
will use several related variables, it is important to first define
association as the context based relation between concepts, usually
found in text or popular culture (Nelson, McEvoy, \& Dennis, 2000). Such
word associations typically arise through their co-occurrence together
in language. For example, the terms PEANUT and BUTTER have become
associated over time through their joint use to depict a particular type
of food, though separately, the two concepts share very little in terms
of meaning. To generate these norms, participants engage in a free
association task, in which they are presented with a cue word and are
asked to list the first related target word that comes to mind. The
probability of producing a given response to a particular cue word can
then be determined by dividing the number of participants who produced
the response in question by the total number of responses generated for
that word (Nelson et al., 2000). Using this technique, researchers have
developed databases of associative word norms that can be used to
generate stimuli with a high degree of reliability. Many of these
databases are now readily available online, with the largest one
consisting of over 72,000 associates generated from more than 5,000 cue
words (Nelson et al., 2004).

Similar to association norms, semantic word norms provide researchers
with another means of constructing stimuli for recall tasks. These norms
measure the underlying concepts represented by words and allow
researchers to tap into aspects of semantic memory. Semantic memory is
best described as an organized collection of our general knowledge and
contains information regarding a concept's meaning (Hutchison, 2003).
Models of semantic memory broadly fall into one of two categories.
Connectionist models (Rogers \& McClelland, 2006; e.g, Rumelhart,
McClelland, \& Group, 1986) portray semantic memory as a system of
interconnected units representing concepts, which are linked together by
weighted connections representing knowledge. By triggering the input
units, activation will then spread throughout the system activating or
suppressing connected units based on the weighted strength of the
corresponding unit connections (M. N. Jones, Willits, \& Dennis, 2015).
On the other hand, distributional models of semantic memory posit that
semantic representations are created through the co-occurrences of words
together in a body of text and suggest that words with similar meanings
will appear together in similar contexts (Riordan \& Jones, 2011).

Feature production tasks are a common means of producing semantic word
norms (Buchanan, Holmes, Teasley, \& Hutchison, 2013; McRae, Cree,
Seidenberg, \& McNorgan, 2005; Vinson \& Vigliocco, 2008) In such tasks,
participants are shown the name of a concept and are asked to list what
they believe the concept's most important features to be (McRae et al.,
2005). Several statistical measures have been developed which measure
the degree of feature overlap between concepts. Similarity between any
two concepts can be measured by representing them as vectors and
calculating the cosine (COS) between them (Maki, McKinley, \& Thompson,
2004). For example, the pair HORNET - WASP has a COS of .88, indicating
high overlap between the two concepts. Feature overlap can also be
measured by JCN, which involves calculating the information content for
each concept and the lowest super-ordinate shared by each concept using
an online dictionary, WordNET (Miller, 1995). The JCN value is then
computed by summing together the difference of each concept from their
lowest super-ordinate (Jiang \& Conrath, 1997; Maki et al., 2004). The
advantage to using COS values over JCN values is the limitation of JCN
tied to a somewhat static dictionary database, as a semantic feature
production task can be used on any concept to calculate COS values.
However, JCN values are less time consuming to obtain if both concepts
are in the database (Buchanan et al., 2013).

Semantic relations can be broadly described as being taxonomic or
thematic in nature. Whereas taxonomic relationships focus on the
connections between features and concepts within categories (e.g., BIRD
- PIDGEON), thematic relationships center around the links between
concepts and an overarching theme or scenario (e.g., BIRD - NEST, L. L.
Jones \& Golonka, 2012). Jouravlev and McRae (2016) provide a list of
100 thematic relatedness production norms, which were generated through
a task similar to feature production in which participants were
presented with a concept and were asked to list names of other concepts
they believed to be related. Distributional models of semantic memory
also lend themselves well to the study of thematic word relations.
Because these models are text based and score word pair relations in
regard to their overall context within a document, they assess thematic
knowledge as well as semantic knowledge. Additionally, text based models
such as latent semantic analysis (LSA) are able to account for both the
effects of context and similarity of meaning, bridging the gap between
associations and semantics (Landauer, Foltz, Laham, Folt, \& Laham,
1998).

Discussion of these measures naturally raises the question of whether
they truly assess unique concepts or simply tap into our overall
linguistic knowledge. Taken at face value, word pair associations and
semantics word relations appear to be vastly different, yet the line
between semantics/associations and thematics is much more blurred. While
thematic word relations are indeed an aspect of semantic memory and
includes word co-occurrence as an integral part of creation, themes
appear to be indicative of a separate area of linguistic processing.
Previous research by Maki and Buchanan (2008) appears to confirm this
theory. Using clustering and factor analysis techniques, they analyzed
multiple associative, semantic, and text based measures of associative
and semantic knowledge. Their findings suggest associative measures to
be separate from semantic measures. Additionally, semantic information
derived from lexical measures (e.g.~COS, JCN) was found to be separate
from measures generated from analysis of text corpora, suggesting that
text based measures may be more representative of thematic information.

While it is apparent that these word relation measures are assessing
different domains of our linguistic knowledge, care must be taken when
building experimental stimuli through the use of normed databases, as
many word pairs overlap on multiple types of measurements, and even the
first studies on semantic priming used association word norms for
stimuli creation (Lucas, 2000; Meyer \& Schvaneveldt, 1971; Meyer,
Schvaneveldt, \& Ruddy, 1975). This observation becomes strikingly
apparent when one desires the creation of word pairs related on only one
dimension. One particular difficulty faced by researchers comes when
attempting to separate association strength from feature overlap, as
highly associated items tend to be semantically related as well.
Additionally, a lack of association strength between two items may not
necessarily be indicative of a total lack of association, as traditional
norming tasks typically do not produce a large enough set of responses
to capture all available associations between items. Some items with
extremely weak associations may inevitably slip through the cracks
(Hutchison, 2003).

\subsection{Application to Judgment
Studies}\label{application-to-judgment-studies}

Traditional judgment of learning tasks (JOL) can be viewed as an
application of the PAL paradigm; participants are given pairs of items
and are asked to judge how accurately they would be able to correctly
match the target with the cue on a recall task. Judgments are typically
made out of 100, with 100 indicating full confidence recall ability. In
their 2005 study, Koriat and Bjork examined overconfidence in JOLs by
manipulating associative relations (FSG) between word-pairs and found
that subjects were more likely to overestimate recall for pairs with
little or no associative relatedness. Additionally, this study found
that when accounting for associative direction, subjects were more
likely to overestimate recall for pairs that were high in backwards
strength but low in forward strength. Koriat and Bjork proposed that
this overconfidence was the product of a foresight bias, which they
considered an inverse of the widely investigated hindsight bias.

JOL tasks can be manipulated to investigate perceptions of word pair
relationships by having participants judge how related they believe the
stimuli to be (Maki, 2007a, 2007b). Judged values can then be compared
to the normed databases to create a similar accuracy function or
correlation as is created in JOL studies. When presented with the item
pair, participants are asked to estimate the number of people out of 100
who would provide the target word when shown only the cue (Maki, 2007a),
which mimics how the association word norms were created. Maki (2007a)
investigated such judgments within the context of associative memory and
found that responses greatly overestimated the strength of relationship
for pairs that were weak associates, while underestimating strong
associates; thus replicating the Koriat and Bjork (2005) findings for
judgments on memory, rather than on learning. The judgment of
associative memory function (JAM) is created by plotting the judged
values by the word pair's normed associative strength and calculating a
fit line, which characteristically has a high intercept (bias) with a
shallow slope (sensitivity). The JAM function was found to be highly
reliable and generalized across multiple variations of the study, with
item characteristics such as word frequency, cue set size (QSS), and
semantic similarity having a minimal influence on it (Maki, 2007b). An
applied meta-analysis of more than ten studies on JAM indicated that
bias and sensitivity are nearly unchangeable, often hovering around
40-60 points for the intercept and .20-.30 for the slope (Valentine \&
Buchanan, 2013). Additionally, Valentine and Buchanan (2013) extended
this research to judgments of semantic memory with the same results.

The present study combined PAL and JAM to examine item recall within the
context of judgment, while extending the JAM task to include judgments
of semantic and thematic memory. Relationship strengths between word
pairs were manipulated across each of the three types of memory
investigated using previous research on databases to assure a range of
relatedness. We tested the following hypotheses:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi})}
\item
  First, we sought to expand previous Maki (2007a), Maki (2007b),
  Buchanan (2010), and Valentine and Buchanan (2013) research to include
  three types of judgments of memory in one experiment, while
  replicating bias and sensitivity findings. We used the three database
  norms for association, semantics, and thematics to predict each type
  of judgment and calculated average slope and intercept values for each
  participant. We expected to find slope and intercept values that were
  significantly different from zero, as well as within the range of
  previous findings. Additionally, we examined the frequency of each
  predictor being the strongest variable to predict its own judgment
  condition (i.e.~how often association was the strongest predictor of
  associative judgments, etc.).
\item
  Given the overlap in these variables, we expected to find an
  interaction between database norms in predicting participant
  judgments, controlling for judgment type. We used multilevel modeling
  to examine that interaction of database norms for association,
  semantics, and thematics in relation to participant judgments.
\item
  These analyses were then extended to recall as the dependent variable
  of interest. We examined the interaction of database norms in
  predicting recall by using a multilevel logistic regression, while
  controlling for judgment type and rating. We expected to find that
  database norms would show differences in recall based on the levels
  other variables (the interaction would be significant), and that
  ratings would also positively predict recall (i.e.~words that
  participants thought were more related would be remembered better).
\item
  Finally, we examined if the judgment slopes from Hypothesis 1 would be
  predictive of recall. Hypothesis 3 examined the direct relationship of
  word relatedness on recall, while this hypothesis explored if
  participant sensitivity to word relatedness was a predictor of recall.
  For this analysis, we used a multilevel logistic regression to control
  for multiple judgment slope conditions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

One-hundred and twelve participants were recruited from Amazon's
Mechanical Turk. Mechanical Turk is a website that allows individuals to
host projects and connects them with a large pool of respondents who
complete them for small amounts of money (Buhrmester, Kwang, \& Gosling,
2011). Participant responses were screened for a basic understanding of
the study's instructions. Common reasons for rejecting responses
included participants entering related words when numerical judgment
responses were required, and participants responding to the cue words
during the recall phase with sentences or phrases instead of individual
words. Those that completed the study correctly were compensated \$1.00
for their participation.

\subsection{Materials}\label{materials}

The stimuli used were sixty-three words pairs of varying associative,
semantic, and thematic relatedness which were created from the Buchanan
et al. (2013) word norm database and website. Associative relatedness
was measured with Forward Strength (FSG), which is the probability that
a cue word will elicit a desired target word (Nelson et al., 2004). This
variable ranges from zero to one wherein zero indicates no association,
while one indicates that participants would always give a target word in
response to the cue word. Semantic relatedness was measured with Cosine
(COS), which is a measure of semantic feature overlap (Buchanan et al.,
2013; McRae et al., 2005; Vinson \& Vigliocco, 2008). This variable
ranges from zero to one where zero indicates no shared semantic features
between concepts and higher numbers indicate more shared features
between concepts. Thematic relatedness was calculated with Latent
Semantic Analysis (LSA), which generates a score based upon the
co-occurrences of words within a document (Landauer \& Dumais, 1997;
Landauer et al., 1998). LSA values also range from zero to one,
indicates no co-occurrence at the low end and higher co-occurrence with
higher values. These values were chosen to represent these categories
based on face validity and previous research on how word pair
psycholinguistic variables overlap (Maki \& Buchanan, 2008).

Stimuli were varied such that each variable included a range of each
variable. See Table \ref{tab:stim-table} for stimuli averages, SD, and
ranges. A complete list of stimuli can be found at
\url{http://osf.io/y8h7v}. The stimuli were arranged into three blocks
for each judgment condition described below wherein each block contained
21 word pairs. Due to limitations of the available stimuli, blocks were
structured so that each one contained seven word pairs of low (0-.33),
medium (.34-.66), and high (.67-1.00) COS relatedness. Because of this
selection process, FSG and LSA strengths are contingent upon the
selected stimuli's COS strengths. We selected stimuli within the cosine
groupings to cover a range of FSG and LSA values, but certain
combinations are often difficult to achieve. For example, there are only
four word-pairs that are both high COS and high FSG, thus limiting the
ability to manipulate LSA. The study was built online using Qualtrics,
and three surveys were created to counter-balance the order in which
blocks appeared. Each word pair appeared counter-balanced across each
judgment condition, and stimuli were randomized within each block.

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

The present study was divided into three phases. In the first section,
participants were presented with word pairs and were asked to make
judgments of how related they believed the words in each pair to be.
This Judgment phase consisted of three blocks of 21 word pairs which
corresponded to one of three types of word pair relationships:
associative, semantic, or thematic. Each block was preceded by a set of
instructions explaining one of the three types of relationships, and
participants were provided with examples which illustrated the type of
relationship to be judged. Participants were then presented with the
word pairs to be judged. The associative instructions explained
associative memory and the role of free association tasks. Participants
were provided with examples of both strong and weak associates. For
example, LOST and FOUND and were presented as an example of a strongly
associated pair, while ARTICLE was paired with NEWSPAPER, THE, and
CLOTHING to illustrate that words can have many weak associates. The
semantic instructions provided a brief overview of how words are related
by meaning and provided examples of concepts with both high and low
feature overlap. TORTOISE and TURTLE are provided as an example of two
concepts with significant overlap. Other examples are then provided to
illustrate concepts with little or no overlap. For the thematic
instructions, participants were provided with an explanation of thematic
relatedness. TREE is explained to be related to LEAF, FRUIT, and BRANCH,
but not COMPUTER. Participants are then given three concepts (LOST, OLD,
ARTICLE) and are asked to come up with words that they feel are
thematically related. The complete experiment can be found at
\url{http://osf.io/y8h7v} for review of the structure and exact
instructions given to participants. These instructions were modeled
after Buchanan (2010) and Valentine and Buchanan (2013).

Participants then rated the relatedness of the word pairs based on the
set of instructions that they received. Judgments were made using a
scale of zero to one hundred, with zero indicating no relationship, and
one hundred indicating a perfect relationship. Participants typed in the
number into the survey. Once completed, participants then completed the
remaining Judgment blocks in the same manner. Each subsequent Judgment
block changed the type of Judgment being made. Three versions of the
study were created, which counter-balanced the order in which the
Judgment blocks appeared, and participants were randomly assigned to
survey version. This resulted in each word pair receiving Judgments on
each of the three types relationships. After completing the Judgment
phase, participants were then presented with a short distractor task to
account for recency effects. In this section, participants were
presented with a randomized list of the fifty U.S. states and were asked
to arrange them in alphabetical order. This task was timed to last two
minutes. Once time had elapsed, participants automatically progressed to
the final section, which consisted of a cued-recall task. Participants
were presented with each of the 63 cue words from the Judgment section
and were asked to complete each word pair by responding with the correct
target word. Participants were informed that they would not be penalized
for guessing. The cued-recall task included all stimuli in a random
order.

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Data Processing and Descriptive
Statistics}\label{data-processing-and-descriptive-statistics}

First, the recall portion of the study was coded as zero for incorrect
responses, one for correct responses, and NA for participants who did
not complete the recall section (all or nearly all responses were
blank). All word responses to judgment items were deleted and set to
missing data. The final dataset was created by splitting the initial
data file into six sections (one for each of the three experimental
blocks and their corresponding recall scores). Each section was
individually melted using the \emph{reshape} package in \emph{R}
(Wickham, 2007) and was written as a csv file. The six output files were
then combined to form the final dataset. Code is available at
\url{http://osf.io/y8h7v}. With 112 participants, the dataset in long
format included 7,056 rows of potential data (i.e., 112 participants *
63 judgments). One incorrect judgment data point (\textgreater{} 100)
was corrected to NA. Missing data for judgments or recall were then
excluded from the analysis, which includes word responses to judgment
items (i.e.~responding with cat instead of a number). These items
usually excluded a participant from receiving Amazon Mechanical Turk
payment, but were included in the datasets found online. In total, 787
data points were excluded (188 judgment only, 279 recall only, 320
both), leading to a final \emph{N} of 105 participants and 6,269
observations. Recall and judgment scores were then screened for outliers
using Mahalanobis distance at \emph{p} \textless{} .001, and no outliers
were found (T\&F). To screen for multicollinearity, we examined
correlations between judgment items, COS, LSA, and FSG. All correlations
were rs \textless{} .50.

The mean judgment of memory for the associative condition (\emph{M} =
58.74, \emph{SD} = 30.28) was lower than the semantic (\emph{M} = 66.98,
\emph{SD} = 28.31) and thematic (\emph{M} = 71.96, \emph{SD} = 27.80)
judgment conditions. Recall averaged over 60\% for all three conditions:
associative \emph{M} = 63.40, \emph{SD} = 48.18; semantic \emph{M} =
68.02, \emph{SD} = 46.65; thematic \emph{M} = 64.89, \emph{SD} = 47.74.

Our first hypothesis sought to replicate bias and sensitivity findings
from previous research while expanding the JAM function to include three
types of memory. FSG, COS, and LSA were used to predict each type of
judgment. Judgment values were divided by 100, so as to place them on
the same scale as the database norms. Slopes and intercepts were then
calculated for each participant's ratings for each of the three judgment
conditions, as long as they contained at least nine data points out of
the 21 that were possible. Single sample \emph{t}-tests were then
conducted to test if slope and intercept values significantly differed
from zero. See Table \ref{tab:hyp1-table1} for means and standard
deviations. Slopes were then compared to the JAM function, which is
characterized by high intercepts (between 40 and 60 on a 100 point
scale) and shallow slopes (between 20 and 40). Because of the scaling of
our data, to replicate this function, we should expect to find
intercepts ranging from .40 to .60 and slopes in the range of 0.20. to
0.40. Intercepts for associative, semantic, and thematic judgments were
each significant, and all fell within or near the expected range.
Thematic judgments had the highest intercept at .656, while associative
judgments had the lowest intercept at .511.

The JAM slope was successfully replicated for FSG in the associative
judgment condition, with FSG significantly predicting association,
although the slope was slightly higher than expected at .491. COS and
LSA did not significantly predict association. For semantic judgments,
each of the three database norms were significant predictors. However,
JAM slopes were not replicated for this judgment type, as FSG had the
highest slope at .118, followed by LSA .085, and then COS .059. These
findings were mirrored for thematic judgments, as each database norm was
a significant predictor, yet slopes for each predictor fell below range
of the expected JAM slopes. Again, FSG had the highest slope, this time
just out of range at .192, followed closely by LSA at .188.
Interestingly, COS slopes were found to be negative for this judgment
condition, -.081. Overall, although JAM slopes were not successfully
replicated in each judgment type, the high intercepts and shallow slopes
present in all three judgment conditions are still indicative of
overconfidence and insensitivity in participant judgments.

Additionally, we examined the frequency that each predictor was the
maximum strength for each judgment condition. For the associative
condition, FSG was the strongest predictor for 64.0 of the participants,
with COS and LSA being the strongest for only 16.0 and 20.0 of
participants respectively. These differences were less distinct when
examining the semantic and thematic judgment conditions. In the semantic
condition, FSG was highest at 44.1 of participants, LSA was second at
32.4, and COS was least likely at 23.5. Finally, in the thematic
condition, LSA was most likely to be the strongest predictor with 44.6
of participants, with FSG being the second most likely at 36.6, and COS
again being least likely at 18.8. Interestingly, in all three
conditions, COS was least likely to be the strongest predictor, even in
the semantic judgment condition.

As a result of the overlap between variables in Hypothesis 1, the goal
of Hypothesis 2 was to test for an interaction between the three
database norms when predicting participant judgment ratings. First, the
database norms were mean centered to control for multicollinearity. The
\emph{nlme} package and \emph{lme} function were used to calculate these
analyses (Pinheiro, Bates, Debroy, Sarkar, \& R Core Team, 2017). A
maximum likelihood multilevel model was used to test the interaction
between FSG, COS, and LSA when predicting judgment ratings while
controlling for type of judgment, with participant number being used as
the random intercept factor. Multilevel models were used to retain all
data points (rather than averaging over items and conditions), while
controlling for correlated error due to participants, as these models
are advantageous for multiway repeated measures designs (Gelman, 2006).
This analysis resulted in a significant three-way interaction between
FSG, COS, and LSA (\(\beta\) = 3.324, \emph{p} \textless{} .001), which
is examined below in a simple slopes analysis. Table
\ref{tab:hyp2-table} includes values for main effects, two-way, and
three-way interactions.

To investigate this interaction, simple slopes were calculated for low,
average, and high levels of COS. This variable was chosen for two
reasons: first, it was found to be the weakest of the three predictors
in hypothesis one, and second, manipulating COS would allow us to track
changes across FSG and LSA. Significant two-way interactions were found
between FSG and LSA at both low COS (\(\beta\) = -1.492, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001), average COS (\(\beta\) =-0.569, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001), and high COS (\(\beta\) = 0.355, \emph{p} = .013). A second level
was then added to the analysis in which simple slopes were created for
each level of LSA, allowing us to assess the effects of LSA at different
levels of COS on FSG. When both COS and LSA were low, FSG significantly
predicted judgment ratings (\(\beta\) = 0.663, p \textless{} .001). At
low COS and average LSA, FSG decreased but still significantly predicted
judgment ratings (\(\beta\) = 0.375, p \textless{} .001). However, when
COS was low and LSA was high, FSG was not a significant predictor
(\(\beta\) = 0.087, p = .079). A similar set of results was found at the
average COS level. When COS was average and LSA was LOW, FSG was a
significant predictor, (\(\beta\) = 0.381, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).
As LSA increased at average COS levels, FSG decreased in strength:
average COS, average LSA FSG (\(\beta\) = 0.355, \emph{p} .013) and
average COS, high LSA FSG (\(\beta\) = 0.161, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001). This finding suggests that at low COS, LSA and FSG create a
seesaw effect in which increasing levels of thematics is counterbalanced
by decreasing importance of association when predicting recall. FSG was
not a significant predictor when COS was high and LSA was low ( 0.099, p
= .088). At high COS and average LSA, FSG significantly predicted
judgment ratings (\(\beta\) = 0.167, p \textless{} .001), and finally
when both COS and LSA were high, FSG increased and was a significant
predictor of judgment ratings (\(\beta\) = 0.236, p \textless{} .001).
Thus, at high levels of COS, FSG and LSA are complimentary when
predicting recall, increasing together as COS increases. Figure
\ref{fig:hyp2graph} displays the three-way interaction wherein the top
row of figures indicates the seesaw effect, as LSA increases FSG
decreases in strength. The bottom row indicates the complimentary effect
where increases in LSA occur with increases in FSG predictor strength.

Given the results of Hypothesis 2, we then sought to extend the analysis
to participant recall scores. A multilevel logistic regression was used
with the \emph{lme4} package and \emph{glmer()} function (Pinheiro et
al., 2017), testing the interaction between FSG, COS, and LSA when
predicting participant recall. As with the previous hypothesis, we
controlled for type of judgement and, additionally, covaried judgment
ratings. Participants were used as a random intercept factor. Judged
values were a significant predictor of recall, (\(\beta\) = 0.686,
\emph{p} \textless{} .001) where increases in judged strength predicted
increases in recall. A significant three-way interaction was detected
between FSG, COS, and LSA (\(\beta\) = 24.572, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001). See Table \ref{tab:hyp3-table} for main effects, two-way, and
three-way interaction values.

The moderation process from Hypothesis 2 was then repeated, with simple
slopes first calculated at low, average, and high levels of COS. This
set of analyses resulted in significant two-way interactions between LSA
and FSG at low COS (\(\beta\) = -7.845, \emph{p} \textless{} .001) and
high COS (\(\beta\) = 5.811, \emph{p} = .009). No significant two-way
interaction was found at average COS (\(\beta\) = -1.017, \emph{p} =
.493). Following the design of hypothesis two, simple slopes were then
calculated for low, average, and high levels of LSA at the low and high
levels of COS, allowing us to assess how FSG effects recall at varying
levels of both COS and LSA. When both COS and LSA were low, FSG was a
significant predictor of recall (\(\beta\) = 4.116, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001). At low COS and average LSA, FSG decreased from both low levels,
but was still a significant predictor (\(\beta\) = 2.601, \emph{p}
\textless{} .001), and finally, low COS and high LSA, FSG was the
weakest predictor of the three (\(\beta\) = 1.086, \emph{p} = .030). As
with Hypothesis 2, LSA and FSG counterbalanced one another, wherein the
increasing levels of thematics led to a decrease in the importance of
association in predicting recall. At high COS and low LSA, FSG was a
significant predictor (\(\beta\) = 2.447, \emph{p} = .003). When COS was
high and LSA was average, FSG increased as a predictor and remained
significant (\(\beta\) = 3.569, \emph{p} \textless{} .001). This finding
repeated when both COS and LSA were high, with FSG increasing as a
predictor of recall (\(\beta\) = 4.692, \emph{p} \textless{} .001).
Therefore, at high levels of COS, LSA and FSG are complimentary
predictors of recall, increasing together and extending the findings of
Hypothesis 2 to participant recall. Figure \ref{fig:hyp3graph} displays
the three-way interaction. The top left figure indicates the
counterbalancing effect of recall of LSA and FSG, while the top right
figure shows no differences in simple slopes for average levels of
cosine. The bottom left figure indicates the complimentary effects where
LSA and FSG increase together as predictors of recall at high COS
levels.

In our fourth and final hypothesis, we investigated whether the judgment
slopes and intercepts obtained in Hypothesis 1 would be predictive of
recall ability. Whereas Hypothesis 3 indicated that word relatedness was
directly related to recall performance, this hypothesis instead looked
at whether or not participants' sensitivity and bias to word relatedness
could be used a predictor of recall (Maki, 2007b). This analysis was
conducted with a multilevel logistic regression, as described in
Hypothesis 3 where each database slope and intercept was used as
predictors of recall using participant as a random intercept factor.
These analyses were separated by judgment type, so that each set of
judgment slopes and intercepts were used to predict recall. The
separation controlled for the number of variables in the equation, as
all slopes and intercepts would have resulted in overfitting. These
values were obtained from Hypothesis 1 where each participant's
individual slopes and intercepts were calculated for associative,
semantic, and thematic judgment conditions. Table \ref{tab:hyp1-table1}
shows average slopes and intercepts for recall for each of the three
types of memory, and Table \ref{tab:hyp4-table} portrays the regression
coefficients and statistics. In the associative condition, FSG slope
significantly predicted recall (\emph{b} = 0.898, \emph{p} = .008),
while COS slope (\emph{b} = 0.314, \emph{p} = .568) and LSA slope
(\emph{b} = 0.501, \emph{p} = .279) were non-significant. In the
semantic condition, COS slope (\emph{b} = 2.039, \emph{p} \textless{}
.001) and LSA slope (\emph{b} = 1.061, \emph{p} = .020) were both found
to be significant predictors of recall. FSG slope was non-significant in
this condition (\emph{b} = 0.381, \emph{p} = .187). Finally, no
predictors were significant in the thematic condition, though LSA slope
was found to be the strongest (\emph{b} = 0.896, \emph{p} = .090).

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

This study investigated the relationship between associative, semantic,
and thematic word relations and their effect on participant judgments
and recall performance through the testing of four hypotheses. In our
first hypothesis, bias and sensitivity findings first proposed by Maki
(2007a) were successfully replicated in the associative condition, with
slope and intercept values falling within the expected range. While
these findings were not fully replicated when extending the analysis to
include semantic and thematic judgments (as slopes in these conditions
did not fall within the appropriate range), participants still displayed
high intercepts and shallow slopes, suggesting overconfidence in
judgment making and an insensitivity to changes in strength between
pairs. Additionally, when looking at the frequency that each predictor
was the strongest in making judgments, FSG was the best predictor for
both the associative and semantic conditions, while LSA was the best
predictor in the thematic condition. In each of the three conditions,
COS was the weakest predictor, even when participants were asked to make
semantic judgments. This finding suggests that associative relationships
seem to take precedence over semantic relationships when judging pair
relatedness, regardless of what type of judgment is being made.
Additionally, this result may be taken as further evidence of a
separation between associative information and semantic information, in
which associative information is always processed, while semantic
information may be suppressed due to task demands (Buchanan, 2010;
Hutchison \& Bosco, 2007).

Our second hypothesis examined the three-way interaction between FSG,
COS, and LSA when predicting participant judgments. At low semantic
overlap, a seesaw effect was found in which increases in thematic
strength led to decreases in associative predictiveness. This finding
was then replicated in hypothesis 3 when extending the analysis to
predict recall. By limiting the semantic relationships between pairs, an
increased importance is placed on the role of associations and thematics
when making judgments or retrieving pairs. In such cases, increasing the
amount of thematic overlap between pairs results in thematic
relationships taking precedent over associative relationships. However,
when semantic overlap was high, a complimentary relationship was found
in which increases in thematic strength in turn led to increases in the
strength of FSG as a predictor. This result suggests that at high
semantic overlap, associations and thematic relations build upon one
another. Because thematics is tied to both semantic overlap and item
associations, the presence of strong thematic relationships between
pairs during conditions of high semantic overlap boosts the predictive
ability of associative word norms. Again, this complimentary effect was
found when examining both recall and judgments.

Finally, our fourth hypothesis used judgment slopes and intercepts
obtained from hypothesis 1 to investigate if participants' bias and
sensitivity to word relatedness could be used as a predictor of recall.
For the associative condition, the FSG slope significantly predicted
recall. In the semantic condition, recall was significantly predicted by
both the COS and LSA slopes. However, although the LSA slope was the
strongest, no significant predictors were found in the thematic
condition. This result may be due to the fact that thematic
relationships between pairs act as a blend between associations and
semantics. As such, LSA faces increased competition from the associative
and semantic database norms when predicting recall in this manner.

Overall, our findings indicated the degree to which the processing of
associative, semantic, and thematic information impacts retrieval and
judgment making and the interactive relationship that exists between
them. While previous research has shown that memory networks are divided
into separate systems which handle storage and processing for meaning
and association, this interaction is a strong indicator that connections
exist between these networks, linking them to one another. As such, we
propose a three-tiered hypothesis of memory as a means of explaining
this phenomenon. First, the semantic memory network processes features
of concepts and provides a means of categorizing items based on the
similarity of their features. Next, the associative network adds
information for items based on contexts generated by reading or speech.
Finally, the thematic network pulls in information from both the
semantic and associative networks to create a mental representation of
both the item and its place in the world. Viewing this model through the
lens of semantic memory, it is somewhat similar in concept to the
dynamic attractor models (Hopfield, 1982; M. N. Jones et al., 2015;
McLeod, Shallice, \& Plaut, 2000), as these models of semantic memory
take into account multiple restraints (such as links between semantics
and the orthography of the concept in question), which the model make
use of in processing meaning. Our hypothesis, takes this proposal one
step further by linking the underlying meaning of a concept with both
its co-occurrences in everyday language and the general contexts in
which it typically appears. Ultimately, further studies of recall and
judgment within the context of these memory networks are needed to
further explore this notion.
